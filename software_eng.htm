</h3><br>
OpenWebGIS is created on the base of open-source software - the software  with  the open  source code.<br> 
<a>For this project implementation the following software was chosen<a>: <br>
<p align="justify">
1.<a href="http://geoserver.org" target="_blank">Geoserver</a>-is an open source software server written in Java that allows users to share and edit geospatial data.<br>
Designed for interoperability, it publishes data from any major spatial data source using open standards;</p>
<p align="justify">
2.<a href="http://www.openlayers.org/" target="_blank">OpenLayers<a> - OpenLayers makes it easy to put a dynamic map in any web page.<br> It can display map tiles and
markers loaded from any source. OpenLayers has been developed to further the use of geographic information of all kinds. OpenLayers is completely free, 
Open Source JavaScript, released under the 2-clause BSD License (also known as the FreeBSD) ;<p>
<p align="justify">
3.<a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/" target="_blank">PostGIS</a>  - PostGIS adds support for geographic objects to the PostgreSQL object-relational database.<br> In effect, PostGIS 
"spatially enables" the PostgreSQL server, allowing it to be used as a backend spatial database for geographic information systems (GIS) ;</p>
<p align="justify">
4.<a href="http://proj4js.org/" target="_blank">Proj4js</a>  - Proj4js is a JavaScript library to transform point coordinates from one coordinate system to another, including 
datum transformations. (http://trac.osgeo.org/proj4js/) ;</p>
<p align="justify">
5.<a href="https://cesiumjs.org" target="_blank">Cesium</a>  - Cesium is an open source JavaScript library for creating 3D globes and 2D maps in a web browser without a plugin. It uses WebGL for hardware-accelerated graphics, and is cross-platform, cross-browser, and tuned for dynamic-data visualization;</p>
<p align="justify">
6.<a href="http://www.naturalearthdata.com" target="_blank">Political map</a>  - is taken from http://www.naturalearthdata.com</p>
<p align="justify">
7.<a href="https://github.com/shashwatak/satellite-js" target="_blank">The algorithm for calculating the satellite parameters at any particular point in time</a>  - is taken from Shashwat Kandadai https://github.com/shashwatak/satellite-js</p>
<p align="justify">
8.<a href="http://osmbuildings.org/examples" target="_blank">OSM Buildings </a>  -OSM Buildings is JavaScript library for visualizing OpenStreetMaps building geometry on interactive maps. 'OSM Buildings' creates a 3D representation of buildings from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data on a 2D map. OSM Buildings does not generate a real 3D model but uses a clever shading technique to make buildings appear ‘3D’.Copyright (c) 2014, OSM Buildings, Jan Marsch <mail@osmbuildings.org> All rights reserved.
